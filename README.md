# Random League Champion

**[Visit the website](https://fancybaguette.github.io/random-league-champion)**

Don't know who to play in League of Legends? With this app you can roll a random champion with a random set of runes. Data is fetched from Riot's [Data Dragon](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#data-dragon). This is more of a prototype, I plan to redo the app with React in the *near future*.
